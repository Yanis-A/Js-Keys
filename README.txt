So this is the project that I'm the proudest of so far, even if it's not that impressive.
As a music composer, working on very various genres, I work very often with piano VST's. So when we had to come up with a project using ThreeJS / WebGL, I felt like it was a good idea.
The toy piano model is from a certain 'gd52andrew', check his work on Sketchfab :

I've extracted the notes files by myself recording the Noire Kontakt library.

You can have some fun using it, and if you spot someting i could change don't hesitate to tell me, I would be happy to improve this little project!
